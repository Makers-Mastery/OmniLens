# OmniLens
Personal smart glasses project using an entirely novel approach to the optics.

I won't be posting much here yet since I'm since in the design phase of the project but once I have actual work to show it will be posted here and on 
my youtube channel @ https://www.youtube.com/@makersmastery <br>
<br>
I'm really excited to show off what I've been up to but it's not ready to show off just yet, since my approach is so unique if it works it might just be a million dollar idea, so I don't want to play all my cards just yet. Stay tuned for more.
